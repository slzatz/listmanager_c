There are three high level modes:  OUTLINE, DATABASE and EDITOR.

The following commands all move from OUTLINE mode to DATABASE mode:

  "<" || SHIfT_TAB || "\t" || left arrow from 0 char position

To move from DATABASE mode to OUTLINE mode:

  ESC || right arrow || ":" puts in COMMAND_LINE and switches to NORMAL mode

ctrl-h in NORMAL mode for editor and outline try to markup links.
